Requirement

Create a Spring Boot Java REST server to be used in a micro-service architecture environment. Use MongoDB version 5.0 or higher as your database. You can use a free cloud-based MongoDB server or a local embedded server. We also expect production level code.
Schema: (Feel free to add additional fields you think are needed)

Cycle collection: assume 10 million documents
•	String: id (primary key, auto-generated by MongoDB)
•	String: mdn (the phone number of a customer)
•	Date: startDate (the start date of a billing cycle)
•	Date: endDate (the end date of a billing cycle)
•	String: userId (foreign key to the id of the user collection)
 
User collection: assume 1 million documents
•	String: id, primary key, auto generated by MongoDB
•	String: firstName, first name of the customer
•	String: lastName, last name of the customer
•	String: email, email of the customer
•	String: password, used for the login to our system
 
Daily_Usage collection: assume 50 million documents
•	String: id, primary key, auto generated by MongoDB
•	String: mdn, the phone number associated with the usage
•	String: userId, the customer who owns this phone number, foreign key to user collection
•	Date: usageDate, example: ISODate("2023-10-25T00:00:00.000-0400"), 
•	Number: usedInMb, the usage of that day from 10-25 00:00:00 EST to 10-25 23:59:59 EST
 
Assume that the usage collection is updated every 15 minutes for the usedInMb field. 
Assume that we can transfer an mdn (the phone number) from user A to user B.
Assume that the userId provided is trustworthy (extracted from JWT) and from a higher level micro-service.
 
Create some APIs, assume all input and output format is JSON:
•	Get the current cycle daily usage for a given customer 
o	Input: userId, mdn 
o	Output: list of {date, daily usage}
•	Get the cycle history of a given mdn
o	Input: userId, mdn
o	Output: list of {cycleId, startDate, endDate}
•	Create a new user
o	Input: first name, last name, email, password
o	Output: {id, firstName, lastName, email}
•	Update existing user profile
o	Input: userId, firstname, last name, email
o	Output: {id, firstName, lastName, email}
 
Additional Requirements:
•	Unit tests with mock data
•	Data tests with an embedded MongoDB server
•	Documentation
•	Add initial data inside your MongoDB database
•	Explain your thought process in the service design and put it in a ReadMe file
 
Bonus functionality you can choose to implement:
•	Use of a Docker container
•	Secret credential management
•	Auditing DB changes
•	Describe in your ReadMe file any improvements you would like to make to the DB or API design
